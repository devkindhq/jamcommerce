## People in Pakistan are looking for your help.

The floods in Pakistan have devastated the lives of many and killed and injured numerous people. Many of them have lost their homes, personal belongings, cattle and crops as a result of the havoc wreaked upon our lands.

Pakistan has declared a National Emergency as more than 1,300 people have lost their lives in tragic natural calamity. According to the latest government data, more than 33 million people have been impacted by the flood. A third of Pakistan is currently underwater, along with over a million homes being damaged or destroyed. 

Sindh Province has been the hardest hit with almost 15 million people homeless and half of the province underwater. The province has lost 90% of its crops. And there are fears of an approaching famine and inflation if the situation doesn't get better. There have also been thousands of cases of deaths due to starvation and widespread diseases between the flood affected population. According to the UN and UNICEF, more than 3 million children are in need of humanitarian assistance and at increased risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition.

We at Shahul & Zeenat Foundation aim at providing meals and medical aid to the affected in Sukkur, and the nearby districts.

A group of brothers and sisters who are mostly students are trying to do their best to help people around the region. We request everyone to come forward and donate and extend solidarity to the people. 

**How will the funds be utilised? **

Our core focus is to provide the families with three time meals and cover basic medical and hygiene necessities of the children and adults.
One time food for a family - $10

Basic medical and hygiene for family - $20

Give a weekâ€™s ration for a family - $35

One month's meal, medical and basic hygiene for a family - $100

In a country already battling an economic crisis and political instability, these unprecedented rains of summer 2022 have set our most vulnerable people back in the most unfathomable way.
